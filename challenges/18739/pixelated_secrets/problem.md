## Description

A mysterious jpg image has been sent to me. From the outside it looks normal, but I have a feeling
that there is something off about it. I can't pinpoint what it is. It looks completely normal… or does it?
I need your help to inspect it for me.

## Details

Download the image here: {{url_for("ctf_challenge_image.jpg", "ctf_challenge_image")}}

## Hints
- Sometimes images contain more than they seem.
- JPGs don’t support LSB… but PNGs do ;)
- A hex editor such as 010 Editor may be a good starting place.
